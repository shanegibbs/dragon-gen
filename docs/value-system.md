# Dragon Internal Value System

## Overview

The internal value system represents the core principles and beliefs that guide a dragon's decisions, judgments, and moral framework. Unlike personality traits (which describe *how* a dragon behaves), values describe *what* a dragon believes in and prioritizes.

## Core Values

Each dragon has a set of core values, each measured on a scale from 0 to 100. These values influence how dragons evaluate actions, form opinions of others, and make decisions.

### 1. Honor (0-100)
**What it means**: Commitment to integrity, keeping promises, and maintaining personal dignity.

- **Low (0-30)**: Pragmatic, may break rules if beneficial, flexible ethics
- **Medium (31-70)**: Generally honorable but with some flexibility
- **High (71-100)**: Unwavering integrity, keeps promises at all costs, strong sense of duty

**Influence**: Dragons with high honor respect others with high honor, and may lose respect for those who break promises or act dishonorably.

### 2. Freedom (0-100)
**What it means**: Value for independence, autonomy, and resistance to constraints.

- **Low (0-30)**: Comfortable with structure, rules, and following traditions
- **Medium (31-70)**: Balanced between independence and cooperation
- **High (71-100)**: Strongly values personal freedom, resents being controlled, prefers autonomy

**Influence**: Traditional dragons bond with others who respect customs. They may clash with highly curious or freedom-loving dragons who challenge traditions.

### 4. Growth (0-100)
**What it means**: Belief in progress, learning, self-improvement, and embracing change.

**Influence**: Harmony-focused dragons may mediate conflicts. They appreciate peaceful dragons and may avoid aggressive ones.

### 8. Power (0-100)

## Value Compatibility

Values can create compatibility or conflict between dragons, but these are discovered through communication:

### Complementary Values
- **Honor + Tradition**: Both value respect for established principles
- **Community + Protection**: Both prioritize collective welfare
- **Growth + Wisdom**: Both value learning and improvement
- **Freedom + Achievement**: Both value personal autonomy and success

### Conflicting Values
- **Freedom vs. Community**: Individual autonomy vs. collective good
- **Tradition vs. Growth**: Maintaining old ways vs. embracing change
- **Power vs. Harmony**: Seeking influence vs. avoiding conflict
- **Achievement vs. Protection**: Personal success vs. caring for others

## How Values Influence Communication

1. **Communication Generation**: Dragons express their values in communications. A high-honor dragon will communicate about honor, a high-community dragon will communicate about working together.

2. **Communication Processing**: When receiving a communication about a value:
   - **Shared high value**: Receiver responds positively, opinion increases
   - **Conflicting value**: Receiver responds negatively, opinion decreases
   - **Neutral value**: Receiver acknowledges politely, minimal opinion change

3. **Opinion Formation**: Dragons form opinions based on how communications align with their values. High-honor dragons respect others who express honor.

4. **Relationship Development**: Shared values discovered through communication create stronger bonds. Conflicting values discovered through communication create tension.

5. **No Pre-computation**: Dragons don't know each other's values until they communicate. Value alignment or conflict is discovered organically through interactions.

## Implementation Considerations

- Values are generated when a dragon is created, with element-based adjustments
- Values influence what communications dragons generate (high values are expressed)
- Values influence how dragons respond to communications (shared values = positive, conflicts = negative)
- Values create emergent relationship dynamics through the communication system
- Values remain relatively stable throughout a dragon's life
