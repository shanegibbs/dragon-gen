# Dragon Internal Value System

## Overview

The internal value system represents the core principles and beliefs that guide a dragon's decisions, judgments, and moral framework. Unlike personality traits (which describe *how* a dragon behaves), values describe *what* a dragon believes in and prioritizes.

## Core Values

Each dragon has a set of core values, each measured on a scale from 0 to 100. These values influence how dragons evaluate actions, form opinions of others, and make decisions.

### 1. Honor (0-100)
**What it means**: Commitment to integrity, keeping promises, and maintaining personal dignity.

- **Low (0-30)**: Pragmatic, may break rules if beneficial, flexible ethics
- **Medium (31-70)**: Generally honorable but with some flexibility
- **High (71-100)**: Unwavering integrity, keeps promises at all costs, strong sense of duty

**Influence**: Dragons with high honor respect others with high honor, and may lose respect for those who break promises or act dishonorably.

### 2. Freedom (0-100)
**What it means**: Value for independence, autonomy, and resistance to constraints.

- **Low (0-30)**: Comfortable with structure, rules, and following traditions
- **Medium (31-70)**: Balanced between independence and cooperation

## Value Compatibility

Values can create compatibility or conflict between dragons:

### Complementary Values
- **Honor + Tradition**: Both value respect for established principles
- **Community + Protection**: Both prioritize collective welfare
- **Growth + Wisdom**: Both value learning and improvement
- **Freedom + Achievement**: Both value personal autonomy and success

### Conflicting Values
- **Freedom vs. Community**: Individual autonomy vs. collective good
- **Tradition vs. Growth**: Maintaining old ways vs. embracing change
- **Power vs. Harmony**: Seeking influence vs. avoiding conflict
- **Achievement vs. Protection**: Personal success vs. caring for others

## How Values Influence Behavior

1. **Opinion Formation**: Dragons form opinions of others based on value alignment. High-honor dragons respect other honorable dragons.

2. **Decision Making**: When dragons face choices, their values guide them. A high-community dragon will prioritize clan needs over personal desires.

3. **Interaction Quality**: Value-aligned dragons have deeper, more meaningful interactions. Value-conflicted dragons may have respectful disagreements or fundamental conflicts.

4. **Relationship Development**: Shared values create stronger bonds. Conflicting values may create interesting dynamics (opposites attract) or fundamental incompatibility.

5. **Conflict Resolution**: Dragons with high harmony values will seek peaceful solutions. Dragons with high power values may escalate conflicts.

## Implementation Considerations

- Values should be generated when a dragon is created, with element-based adjustments
- Values can influence compatibility calculations alongside personality traits
- Values can affect interaction outcomes (e.g., honor-bound dragons keep promises)
- Values can create interesting narrative moments (e.g., a freedom-loving dragon defying a traditional leader)
- Values may shift slightly over time based on experiences, but core values remain relatively stable
