# Dragon Internal Value System

## Overview

The internal value system represents the core principles and beliefs that guide a dragon's decisions, judgments, and moral framework. Unlike personality traits (which describe *how* a dragon behaves), values describe *what* a dragon believes in and prioritizes.

## Core Values

Each dragon has a set of core values that influence how they evaluate actions, form opinions of others, and make decisions. Values are measured on a scale from 0 to 100.

Some values are naturally conflicting and are represented as axes where a dragon cannot have both values high simultaneously. This ensures internal consistency in a dragon's value system.

### Independent Values

#### Honor (0-100)
**What it means**: Commitment to integrity, keeping promises, and maintaining personal dignity.

- **Low (0-30)**: Pragmatic, may break rules if beneficial, flexible ethics
- **Medium (31-70)**: Generally honorable but with some flexibility
- **High (71-100)**: Unwavering integrity, keeps promises at all costs, strong sense of duty

**Influence**: Dragons with high honor respect others with high honor, and may lose respect for those who break promises or act dishonorably.

#### Wisdom (0-100)
**What it means**: Value for knowledge, understanding, and making well-considered decisions.

- **Low (0-30)**: Acts on instinct, less concerned with deep understanding
- **Medium (31-70)**: Values some knowledge but not obsessive
- **High (71-100)**: Deeply values learning, seeks understanding, respects age and experience

**Influence**: Wisdom-focused dragons appreciate patient, curious dragons. They may mentor younger dragons or seek guidance from elders.

### Value Axes

Some values are naturally conflicting and are represented as axes where a dragon cannot have both values high simultaneously. This ensures internal consistency in a dragon's value system.

#### Freedom vs Community Axis (0-100)
**What it means**: The tension between individual autonomy and collective good.

- **High axis value (71-100)**: High Freedom - Strongly values personal freedom, resents being controlled, prefers autonomy
- **Low axis value (0-30)**: High Community - Puts clan first, values cooperation, sacrifices for the group
- **Medium (31-70)**: Balanced between independence and cooperation

A dragon cannot simultaneously prioritize individual autonomy above all and put the collective good first.

#### Tradition vs Growth Axis (0-100)
**What it means**: The tension between maintaining old ways and embracing change.

- **High axis value (71-100)**: High Tradition - Deeply values ancestral customs, resistant to change, reveres history
- **Low axis value (0-30)**: High Growth - Always seeking to improve, values learning, embraces innovation
- **Medium (31-70)**: Respects some traditions but open to innovation

A dragon cannot simultaneously resist change and embrace innovation.

#### Power vs Harmony Axis (0-100)
**What it means**: The tension between seeking influence and avoiding conflict.

- **High axis value (71-100)**: High Power - Strongly values power, seeks to influence others, respects strength
- **Low axis value (0-30)**: High Harmony - Strongly avoids conflict, seeks balance, values peace above all
- **Medium (31-70)**: Prefers peace but will stand up when needed

A dragon cannot simultaneously seek to influence others through strength and avoid all conflict.

#### Achievement vs Protection Axis (0-100)
**What it means**: The tension between personal success and caring for others.

- **High axis value (71-100)**: High Achievement - Highly competitive, seeks recognition, driven to excel
- **Low axis value (0-30)**: High Protection - Strongly protective, defends others, values safety and care
- **Medium (31-70)**: Some ambition but also willing to help when needed

A dragon cannot simultaneously prioritize personal success above all and put others' welfare first.

## Element-Based Value Tendencies

Each dragon element influences their base values, similar to how they influence personality traits. For value axes, adjustments move the axis toward the preferred value.

For detailed information about each element's value tendencies, typical values, and philosophy, see [dragon-elements.md](dragon-elements.md).

## Value Compatibility

Values can create compatibility or conflict between dragons, but these are discovered through communication:

### Internal Consistency
- Dragons cannot have conflicting values high simultaneously (e.g., high tradition and high growth)
- Conflicting value pairs are represented as axes, ensuring internal consistency
- This prevents dragons from having contradictory value systems

### Complementary Values
- **Honor + Tradition**: Both value respect for established principles
- **Community + Protection**: Both prioritize collective welfare (when community is high on the axis)
- **Growth + Wisdom**: Both value learning and improvement (when growth is high on the axis)
- **Freedom + Achievement**: Both value personal autonomy and success (when freedom is high on the axis)

### Inter-Dragon Value Conflicts
While dragons cannot have conflicting values internally, they can still conflict with other dragons:
- **Freedom vs. Community**: A high-freedom dragon may conflict with a high-community dragon
- **Tradition vs. Growth**: A traditional dragon may clash with a growth-oriented dragon
- **Power vs. Harmony**: A power-focused dragon may conflict with a harmony-seeking dragon
- **Achievement vs. Protection**: An achievement-focused dragon may clash with a protection-focused dragon

## How Values Influence Communication

1. **Communication Generation**: Dragons express their values in communications. A high-honor dragon will communicate about honor, a high-community dragon will communicate about working together.

2. **Communication Processing**: When receiving a communication about a value:
   - **Shared high value**: Receiver responds positively, opinion increases
   - **Conflicting value**: Receiver responds negatively, opinion decreases
   - **Neutral value**: Receiver acknowledges politely, minimal opinion change

3. **Opinion Formation**: Dragons form opinions based on how communications align with their values. High-honor dragons respect others who express honor.

4. **Relationship Development**: Shared values discovered through communication create stronger bonds. Conflicting values discovered through communication create tension.

5. **No Pre-computation**: Dragons don't know each other's values until they communicate. Value alignment or conflict is discovered organically through interactions.

## Implementation Considerations

- Values are generated when a dragon is created, with element-based adjustments
- Conflicting value pairs are represented as axes (0-100), ensuring internal consistency
- Individual values are derived from axes (e.g., freedom = axis value, community = 100 - axis value)
- Values influence what communications dragons generate (high values are expressed)
- Values influence how dragons respond to communications (shared values = positive, conflicts = negative)
- Values create emergent relationship dynamics through the communication system
- Values remain relatively stable throughout a dragon's life
