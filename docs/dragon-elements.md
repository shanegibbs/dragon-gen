# Dragon Elements

## Overview

Each dragon belongs to one of six elemental types: Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Lightning, and Ice. An element is a fundamental aspect of a dragon's nature that influences their personality traits, values, and even their name. Elements shape how dragons interact with the world and with each other.

Elements influence:
- **Personality Traits**: Each element has tendencies toward certain traits (e.g., Fire dragons tend to be more aggressive and dominant)
- **Values**: Elements influence a dragon's core values and philosophical outlook
- **Naming Patterns**: Each element has characteristic name prefixes and suffixes

## Element Interactions

Elements influence how dragons interact with each other, but relationships are still emergent through communication. Dragons of different elements may find common ground through shared values or traits, or they may clash due to conflicting philosophies.

For example:
- **Fire and Water**: May conflict due to Fire's aggression vs Water's harmony-seeking nature
- **Earth and Wind**: May clash due to Earth's tradition vs Wind's love of change
- **Lightning and Ice**: May have interesting dynamics with Lightning's intensity vs Ice's contemplative nature

However, these are tendencies, not rules. Individual dragons' traits and values, discovered through communication, determine the actual relationships that form.

## Implementation Notes

- Elements are assigned when dragons are created
- Element-based adjustments are applied to randomly generated traits and values
- Name generation uses element-specific prefixes and suffixes
- Elements influence but don't determine a dragon's personality - there is still significant variation
