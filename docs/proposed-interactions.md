# Proposed Dragon Interactions and Actions (draft)

This document proposes new types of interactions and actions that dragons can take to express their values and traits beyond simple communication. These actions would create richer social dynamics and more meaningful character expression.

## Design Principles

1. **Value-Driven**: Actions should clearly express what a dragon values (honor, wisdom, freedom, etc.)
2. **Trait-Expressive**: Actions should reflect how a dragon behaves (friendly, aggressive, curious, etc.)
3. **Relationship Impact**: Actions should affect relationships in meaningful ways
4. **Emergent Dynamics**: Actions should create interesting, emergent social situations
5. **Energy/Mood Effects**: Actions can affect dragon state (energy, mood) to create trade-offs

## Implementation Considerations

### Action Selection
- Dragons should choose actions based on their highest values and strongest traits
- Actions can be triggered by:
  - Dragon's internal state (high energy, good mood)
  - Situational context (conflict, group activity, opportunity)
  - Relationship state (wanting to strengthen bonds, resolve conflicts)
  - Random chance (dragons act on their values/traits periodically)

### Energy and Mood Effects
- Some actions consume energy (challenges, competitions, defending)
- Some actions restore energy (resting, meditating, social bonding)
- Actions can affect mood (successful actions improve mood, failures may lower it)
- High-energy dragons may be more likely to take active actions

### Relationship Impact
- Actions should have more significant relationship impacts than simple communication
- Actions demonstrate commitment and character more clearly
- Failed actions (e.g., breaking a promise) should have strong negative impacts
- Successful actions that align with receiver's values should have strong positive impacts

### Emergent Dynamics
- Actions can create chains of events (challenge → response → rivalry)
- Actions can involve multiple dragons (group activities, competitions)
- Actions can create ongoing states (promises, mentorship, protection)
- Actions can resolve or create conflicts

### Contextual Triggers
- **Conflict situations**: Mediation, defense, challenge actions become more likely
- **Group activities**: Leadership, organization, participation actions
- **Discovery opportunities**: Exploration, investigation, learning actions
- **Social gatherings**: Friendliness, playfulness, community actions
- **Threat situations**: Protection, defense, guard actions

## Example Action Sequences

### Honor + Protection Sequence
1. Dragon A (high honor, high protection) makes a promise to protect Dragon B
2. Later, Dragon C threatens Dragon B
3. Dragon A defends Dragon B, fulfilling the promise
4. Dragon B's opinion of Dragon A increases significantly (+15)
5. Dragon C's opinion of Dragon A decreases (-8)
6. Other dragons witness and respect Dragon A's honor (+5 each)

### Growth + Aggression Sequence
1. Dragon A (high growth, high aggression) challenges traditional methods
2. Dragon B (high tradition) defends the old ways
3. Dragon A proposes a competition to prove the new method
4. Dragon C (high achievement) joins the competition
5. Competition creates dynamic relationships based on outcomes
6. Winner gains respect, but relationships may be strained

### Wisdom + Patience Sequence
1. Dragon A (high wisdom, high patience) observes a conflict
2. Dragon A waits, studying both sides
3. Dragon A offers thoughtful mediation
4. Both parties appreciate the wisdom (+8 each)
5. Conflict resolves, relationships improve
6. Dragon A gains reputation as a wise mediator

## Benefits of These Actions

1. **Richer Character Expression**: Actions show what dragons value and how they behave more clearly than words
2. **Meaningful Choices**: Dragons make choices that reflect their character
3. **Emergent Stories**: Actions create narrative moments and story arcs
4. **Relationship Depth**: Actions demonstrate commitment and character more than communication alone
5. **Dynamic World**: The world feels more alive with dragons taking actions based on their values
6. **Player Engagement**: Observing and understanding dragon actions becomes more interesting
7. **Value Demonstration**: Values are expressed through actions, not just words
8. **Trait Expression**: Traits manifest in how dragons approach situations

## Next Steps

To implement these actions:

1. **Define Action Types**: Create an enum for action types (similar to CommunicationType)
2. **Action Generation**: Create functions to generate actions based on values/traits
3. **Action Processing**: Create functions to process actions and determine responses
4. **State Management**: Track ongoing actions (promises, mentorship, protection)
5. **Energy/Mood Integration**: Actions should affect dragon state
6. **UI Integration**: Display actions in a meaningful way
7. **Testing**: Ensure actions create interesting, emergent dynamics
